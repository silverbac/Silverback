2) Mandrill

Each board will be added as an entry to the Arduino Tools > Board menu.
                                                   ########## Picture ##########
# Installation Instructions
To add board support for our products, go to File > Preferences, and paste this URL into the 'Additional Boards Manager URLs' input field:
//url + picture
This field can be found in 'Preferences...' under the Arduino File menu.

Now, under the Tools > Board > Boards Manager..., if you type in "Silverback", you will see an option to install board files for SparkFun Arduino compatible boards. Click "Install" to add these to your list.

NOTE: If you are using Arduino 1.6.6 and the link isn't working for you, change "https" at the beginning of the link to "http" and try again. We're working to figure out why this is happening in version 1.6.6.
